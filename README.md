# ColorClicker Game

ColorClicker is a simple and interactive game where players are presented with a grid of circles, and the objective is to click on the circle that has a different color from the others. The game is implemented using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The game utilizes Tkinter for creating an interactive and visually appealing interface.
- **Colorful Circles:** Each circle in the grid is randomly assigned a color, and the player's challenge is to identify and click on the one with the distinct color.
- **Algorithm Design:** The game involves implementing a thinking algorithm to determine the logic for identifying the circle with the different color.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Select the game mode: Test, Easy, Medium, or Hard.
3. Click on the "Enter the Game" button.
4. A grid of colorful circles will be displayed.
5. Identify the circle with a different color from the others.
6. Click on the identified circle to score points.
7. After finishing the game, you have the option to save or load your points to/from a file.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for game development.
- **Tkinter:** Employed for creating the graphical user interface.

## Learning Points

- **GUI Development:** Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a graphical user interface using Tkinter, including designing windows, buttons, and handling user input.
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Developing the thinking algorithm for identifying the circle with a different color enhanced my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
- **Event Handling:** I learned how to handle user interactions, such as mouse clicks, to make the game interactive and responsive.

## Future Enhancements

- **Levels:** Implement different levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Score Tracking:** Add a scoring system to track and display the player's performance.
- **Timer:** Introduce a time limit for each round, making the game more challenging.
